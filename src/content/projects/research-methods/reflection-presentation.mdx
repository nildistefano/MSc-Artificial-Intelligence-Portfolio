Overall, I am very satisfied with the outcome of both my Literature Review and Research Proposal. The work received excellent feedback across all assessment criteria, including knowledge and understanding, criticality, presentation structure, communication, and use of sources. This reassured me that my approach to research design and written communication is strong and well-aligned with academic expectations at this level.

In particular, I found that completing the Literature Review first gave me a strong foundation for developing the Research Proposal. It helped me to gather, evaluate, and synthesise key sources early on, which made it much easier to formulate a clear research question and methodology later. I was pleased to see that this structured approach was recognised in the feedback, especially in terms of how well the presentation reflected the core ideas and research direction.

One major strength highlighted was my ability to critically discuss my methodology and apply relevant research to support my design. I also appreciated the comments about my presentation skills â€” I took care to make the PowerPoint clear, concise, and visually supportive of my key points.

The only area I will be mindful of is time management, as completing the two tasks to this standard required considerable weekend commitment.
