## Objective

In this project, we aimed to design a neural network model for object recognition using the CIFAR-10 dataset. Object recognition is a critical task in many fields, such as autonomous vehicles, where accurate identification of objects can significantly enhance decision-making processes. The primary goal of this project is to develop a model that can correctly classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 color images across 10 distinct classes. These classes include categories like airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, dogs, and more. The challenge is to design a neural network model that can generalize and correctly identify these objects from the images.

## Data Preprocessing

To begin with, we load the CIFAR-10 dataset, which is divided into a training set, a validation set, and a test set. We split the training data into 80% for training and 20% for validation. Then, we normalize the pixel values and one-hot encode the target labels.

```python
# Loading the CIFAR-10 dataset
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = cifar10.load_data()
print("====== CIFAR10 (Original Split) ======")
print('x_train shape:', x_train.shape)
print('y_train shape:', y_train.shape)
print(x_train.shape[0], 'train samples')
print(x_test.shape[0], 'test samples')

# Splitting training data into training and validation sets
x_train, x_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(x_train, y_train, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y_train)
print("====== CIFAR10 (With Validation Split) ======")
print('x_train shape:', x_train.shape)
print('y_train shape:', y_train.shape)
print(x_train.shape[0], 'train samples')
print(x_val.shape[0], 'val samples')
print(x_test.shape[0], 'test samples')

# Normalizing pixel values from integers (0, 255) to floats (0, 1)
x_train = x_train.astype('float32') / 255
x_val = x_val.astype('float32') / 255
x_test = x_test.astype('float32') / 255

# One-hot encoding target variables
y_train = utils.to_categorical(y_train, CLASS_COUNT)
y_val = utils.to_categorical(y_val, CLASS_COUNT)
y_test = utils.to_categorical(y_test, CLASS_COUNT)
```

## Data Distribution

The dataset is balanced, meaning that each class has an equal number of images, which helps prevent bias toward one class over another. Below is the distribution of images across the training, validation, and test sets.

```python
# Visualizing the class distribution across training, validation, and test sets
class_counts_train = np.bincount(y_train.flatten())
class_counts_val = np.bincount(y_val.flatten())
class_counts_test = np.bincount(y_test.flatten())

fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(15, 5))

# Training Class Distribution
axes[0].bar(CLASS_NAMES, class_counts_train, color=colors, edgecolor='black')
axes[0].set_title('Training Set')
axes[0].set_ylabel('Number of Images')
axes[0].tick_params(axis='x', rotation=45)

# Validation Class Distribution
axes[1].bar(CLASS_NAMES, class_counts_val, color=colors, edgecolor='black')
axes[1].set_title('Validation Set')
axes[1].set_xlabel('Class')
axes[1].tick_params(axis='x', rotation=45)

# Testing Class Distribution
axes[2].bar(CLASS_NAMES, class_counts_test, color=colors, edgecolor='black')
axes[2].set_title('Test Set')
axes[2].tick_params(axis='x', rotation=45)

fig.suptitle('Class Distribution in CIFAR-10 across sets')

plt.tight_layout(rect=[0, 0.03, 1, 0.95])
plt.show()
```

## Model Architecture

For this project, we utilize a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is well-suited for image classification tasks. The architecture consists of two convolutional blocks followed by a classification block. The convolutional layers apply filters to detect local patterns in the image, such as edges and textures, while the dense layers help in making the final classification based on the learned features.

```python
# Building the model
model = Sequential(name="CIFAR10_CNN_v1")

# First convolutional block
model.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), padding='same', activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)))
model.add(BatchNormalization())
model.add(MaxPool2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
model.add(Dropout(0.25))

# Second convolutional block
model.add(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), padding='same', activation='relu'))
model.add(BatchNormalization())
model.add(MaxPool2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
model.add(Dropout(0.25))

# Flatten and Dense layers for classification
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(256, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dropout(0.5))
model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))

model.summary()
```

### Activation Function and Regularization

The ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function is used in the convolutional layers, which helps the model learn more complex patterns without saturating the gradients during backpropagation. Batch normalization is used to stabilize training, while dropout is applied to prevent overfitting.

### Loss Function and Optimization

We use Categorical Cross-Entropy as the loss function for multi-class classification, and the Adam optimizer is used to minimize the loss.

```python
# Compiling the model with Adam optimizer and Categorical Cross-Entropy loss function
model.compile(optimizer='adam', 
              loss='categorical_crossentropy', 
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

### Training the Model

The model is trained for up to 100 epochs with early stopping applied if the validation loss does not improve for 8 consecutive epochs. 
The training process involves monitoring both the training and validation losses to ensure that the model doesn't overfit.

```py
# Early stopping callback to stop training if validation loss doesn't improve
early_stopping = EarlyStopping(
    monitor='val_loss', 
    patience=8,         
    restore_best_weights=True 
)

# Training the model
history = model.fit(x_train, y_train,
    batch_size=32,
    epochs=100,
    validation_data=(x_val, y_val),
    shuffle=True,
    callbacks=[early_stopping]
)
```

###  Training and Validation Plots

We plot the training and validation accuracy and loss to visualize the model's performance during training.

```py
# Plotting accuracy and loss curves for training and validation sets
fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(15, 5)) 

axs[0].plot(history.history['accuracy']) 
axs[0].plot(history.history['val_accuracy']) 
axs[0].set_title('Accuracy')
axs[0].set_ylabel('Accuracy') 
axs[0].set_xlabel('Epoch')
axs[0].legend(['train', 'validate'], loc='upper left')

axs[1].plot(history.history['loss']) 
axs[1].plot(history.history['val_loss']) 
axs[1].set_title('Loss')
axs[1].set_ylabel('Loss') 
axs[1].set_xlabel('Epoch')
axs[1].legend(['train', 'validate'], loc='upper left')
plt.show()
```

### Evaluation and Results

After training, we evaluate the model on the test set and generate a classification report along with a confusion matrix to better understand the model's performance.

```py
# Evaluate the model on the test set
scores = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=1)
print('Test loss:', scores[0])
print('Test accuracy:', scores[1])

# Generating classification report
predictions = np.argmax(model.predict(x_test), axis=-1)
y_test_multiclass = np.argmax(y_test, axis=-1)

print(classification_report(y_test_multiclass, predictions))

# Confusion matrix
confusion_matrix(y_test_multiclass, predictions)
```
### Visualizing Predictions
We randomly select a test image, display it, and compare the real label with the predicted label.

```py
# Visualizing a random test image and comparing real and predicted labels
from random import randint

idx = randint(0, len(x_test)-1)

test_image = x_test[idx]

plt.imshow(test_image)
plt.show()

print(f"Real Label: {CLASS_NAMES[y_test_multiclass[idx]]}")
print(f"Predicted Label: {CLASS_NAMES[predictions[idx]]}")
```


### Conclusion
The model achieved an accuracy of 76% on the test set, demonstrating its capability to classify images correctly. The confusion matrix and classification report further help identify areas where the model can improve. This project highlights the effectiveness of CNNs for image classification tasks and the importance of model regularization and validation during training.
