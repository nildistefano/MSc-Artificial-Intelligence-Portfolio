# Pathological Test Results

The table shows the pathological test results for three individuals.

| Name  | Gender | Fever | Cough | Test-1 | Test-2 | Test-3 | Test-4 |
|-------|--------|-------|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Jack  | M      | Y     | N     | P      | N      | N      | A      |
| Mary  | F      | Y     | N     | P      | A      | P      | N      |
| Jim   | M      | Y     | P     | N      | N      | N      | A      |

# Jaccard Coefficient Calculations

Given:
$$
Jaccard(A, B) = \frac{ \text{Number of Common Positive Indicators}}{\text{Total Number of Indicators}}
$$


## Pair (Jack, Mary)

### Difference of observations in both:  
$$
(Jack \cap Mary) = \{ \text{Test-3} \} = 1
$$

### Total Attributes:
$$
(Jack \cup Mary) = \{ \text{Fever, Cough, Test-3} \} = 3
$$


### Jaccard Coefficient:
$$
    J(Jack, Mary) = \frac{1}{3} = 0.33
$$

## Pair (Jack, Jim)

### Difference of observations in both:  
$$
(Jack \cap Jim) = \{ \text{Cough, Test-1} \} = 2
$$

### Total Attributes:
$$
(Jack \cup Jim) = \{ \text{Fever, Cough, Test-1} \} = 3
$$


### Jaccard Coefficient:
$$
    J(Jack, Jim) = \frac{2}{3} = 0.67
$$

## Pair (Jim, Mary)

### Difference of observations in both:  
$$
(Jim \cap Mary) = \{ \text{Cough, Test-1} \} = 2
$$

### Total Attributes:
$$
(Jim \cup Mary) = \{ \text{Fever, Cough, Test-1, Test-2, Test-3, Test-4} \} = 6
$$


### Jaccard Coefficient:
$$
    J(Jim, Mary) = \frac{1}{6} = 0.17
$$
