### Abstract

This report investigates the application of data analysis techniques to extract insights from the 2019 Airbnb NYC dataset. The goal was to understand pricing patterns, availability trends, and factors that influence traveler preferences across various neighborhoods and room types. The analysis utilized several key techniques: data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), correlation analysis, and clustering analysis.

Data preprocessing involved cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and transforming critical variables for further analysis. EDA revealed significant trends in pricing and room type distribution, highlighting the predominance of mid-range accommodations and a clear preference for privacy and security in listings. Correlation analysis demonstrated that location and room type had a stronger correlation with price than availability or reviews. Finally, K-means clustering was employed to segment the listings based on location and price, uncovering distinct market segments shaped by geographic and pricing factors.

This analysis illustrates the power of machine learning techniques like clustering for market segmentation, providing insights that could lead to more targeted pricing and marketing strategies. Additionally, exploratory techniques such as correlation analysis revealed important relationships in the data, offering actionable insights into factors that drive customer preferences. By leveraging these methods, companies like Airbnb can optimize their offerings, improve their competitive positioning, and better align with customer needs in an increasingly dynamic market. Future analyses could expand on these findings by integrating seasonal and demographic data to refine pricing and marketing strategies even further.

### Project Reflection

This project provided me with a valuable opportunity to apply data analysis techniques in a real-world context. I contributed to the project mainly through my technical expertise and my ability to communicate effectively with my teammates, ensuring that our work was of high quality and aligned with the project goals.

Throughout the project, I played an active role in completing tasks on time and collaborating with my teammates to meet our objectives. The team worked effectively together, with regular communication and a strong distribution of tasks. One teammate took on a leadership role, organizing and guiding the project, which helped steer the group towards success. Another teammateâ€™s proactive approach to starting the project early ensured that we met deadlines ahead of schedule, leaving ample time for review and refinement.

This early start and structured approach allowed the team to focus on the technical aspects of the project without ambiguity. We were able to tackle challenges systematically, resulting in a successful outcome.

Reflecting on my own contributions, I realize that while I was confident in executing tasks and delivering technical results, I could improve in leadership and initiative. Moving forward, I aim to develop stronger leadership skills and become more comfortable with proposing new ideas and guiding the direction of future group efforts. I recognize that honing these abilities will enable me to contribute more holistically and proactively in team settings. My experience in this project has shown me that a balance of technical proficiency and leadership can drive the success of a team, and I look forward to applying these lessons in future projects.
